SID breaks down into two atomic units:
 - **Capsule**: a collection of data
 - **Query**: a way to access that data

## Your first query
We're going to create our first capsule later.
First, let's query a capsule that already exists.
The capsule `rocket-propelled-astroplex` contains Feynman's lectures on physics volume I.
Here's how you can query it (no API key required):

<CodeGroup>
```bash curl
curl -X POST 'https://rocket-propelled-astroplex.sid.ai/query' \
-d '{"query": "what did einsteins special relativity introduce?"}' \
```

```python Python
import requests

url = 'https://rocket-propelled-astroplex.sid.ai/query'
data = {
    "query": "what did einsteins special relativity introduce?"
}

response = requests.post(url, json=data)

print(response.json())
```
</CodeGroup>
Pretty neat! The response should look something like this:
```json
[
  {
    "item_id": "aeb2052b-e60b-4bba-b02f-a599f2465787",
    "idx": 140,
    "content": "15\nThe Special Theory of Relativity\n15-1 The principle of relativity\nFor over 200 years the equations of motion enunciated by Newton were believed\nto describe nature correctly, and the first time that an error in these laws was\ndiscovered, the way to correct it was also discovered.

    "uri": "",
    "kind": "file",

      "time_modified": "2015-04-27T18:39:05Z"
    }
  }, ...
]
```
If you want to learn more about how a query works and what other parameters exist – like `wishlist` and `limit`,
please check out the [API reference](/api-reference/query/query-capsule).
<Note>`rocket-propelled-astroplex` is a public capsule, so no API key is required. If you want to query a private capsule, you'll need to create an API key in the dashboard.</Note>

## Your first capsule
The easiest way to create a capsule is using the dashboard. 
Please remember the ID of the capsule you created – you can always look it up in the dashboard.
It will look something like this: `rocket-propelled-astroplex`.
<Steps>
<Step title="Open the dashboard">
Go to the [dashboard](https://dashboard.sid.ai).
</Step>
<Step title="Create a new capsule">
Navigate to the "Home" tab and click on the "Create a new capsule" button. Remember the unique ID of the capsule you created.
</Step>
<Step title="Add data">
Add some data to the capsule – like a file.
</Step>
<Step title="Create an API key" icon="circle-exclamation">
Navigate to the "API keys" tab and click on the "Create an API key" button.
</Step>
</Steps>
