description: 'Try out the sid API with your own data'

## Overview
The purpose of this quickstart is to allow you to try the API with minimal initial setup.
You'll connect integrations such as google drive and notion to your personal SID account and make API calls for your own data.

## Set up an Account and Get a Token
Head over to our [demo](https://demo.sid.ai) and click the 'Continue with SID' button.
You will be taken to the SID login page, where you can create an account or log in with an existing one.

Once you're logged in, you'll be able to connect integrations to your account.
Some integrations take a longer time to fully index than others, so we recommend starting with Google Drive.

After you've connected your integrations, click on the 'return' button at the bottom of the page.
You'll be asked to give consent to the demo application, and then redirected back to the demo page.

You should now see a token in the top right corner of the page.
This is your access token, which you will be able to use in the following steps.

<Info>
This token is only valid for a day. Read up on [auth flows](/auth/flow) for a proper setup.
</Info>
<Info>
If the token is expired, you can get a new one by disconnecting and reconnecting your SID account,
or by making a request with the demo. This will refresh the token.

## Call the API
Head over to the [query](/api-reference/endpoint/query) page in the API reference. 
You'll see an interface to make API calls right in the browser. 
Simply add your token to the `Authorization` header, add a query to the `body`, and hit send.

To start with, try simply querying for the content of one of the documents from your connected integrations.
For example, if you connected your Google Drive account, try querying for the title of a Google Doc or PDF.

## A Proper Setup
Obviously, in a real deployment you wouldn't want to just query your own data.
To allow your users to connect their own SID account, you'll need to set up a proper [OAuth2 flow](/auth/flow).
This will allow you to programatically obtain an access token for your users, and make API calls on their behalf.
