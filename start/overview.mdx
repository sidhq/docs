SID...
- takes data from almost anywhere
- automatically extracts information
- hosts that information publicly or privately
- lets you use that information with any AI model√•

In order to be the most accurate, we need to be opinionated about how the data is structured, processed, and stored.
SID is probably not a fit if you care about the `ef_construction` value for the <Tooltip tip="If you care, we might be interested in hiring you!">HNSW index</Tooltip>.
We are a fit if you're looking for a self-improving, reliable retrieval pipeline for RAG.

If you're new to SID, we recommend starting with our [quickstart tutorial](/start/quickstart).
<Note>We never train on your data.</Note>
